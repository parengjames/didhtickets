# didhtickets
A system designed to collect and store all IT-related documents, including ticket history, error logs, tutorials, and other essential resources. 
The system integrates an AI-powered chatbot to provide assistance, enabling faster solutions and more efficient problem-solving.

The system is developed using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. In the first phase, the developer chose not to use any frameworks to ensure 
full functionality and core features are properly implemented. Frameworks will be introduced in future phases to 
mprove structure, scalability, and overall system stability.
